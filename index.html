			Hello there! First the boring stuff... I was born and raised in the Atlanta area. I graduated
			from Georgia State University with a Comp Sci degree. My focus was on human computer
			interaction & graphics so I didn't do much code. I had a few coding classes but
			after graduating I didn't put any of it to practice. After school I started working in software
			quality assurance and have now been doing that for over 4 years. I'm currently part of the GATech
			Coding Bootcamp because I want to sharpen my technical skills and become a web developer!
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			...And now the fun stuff. I might be SUPER serious when you first meet me, but soon after you'll
			discover I'm actually SUPER silly. I like to joke around and I'd say I have a great sense of humor.
			I'm a pretty laid back dude so you'd have to be a huge jerk to offend me. I enjoy hiking and try to
			do so whenever I get the chance. I really enjoy gaming on my PC or PS4 and have recently gotten into
			VR gaming which is quite a trip! As far as music goes I listen to various genres but mostly
			rock & metal. I used to hang out quite a bit in East Atlanta Village, and still enjoy making a trip
			down from time to time. Feel free to reach out if you want to know more! Dueces!
